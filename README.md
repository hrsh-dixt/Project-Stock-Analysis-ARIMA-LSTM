# Project-Stock-Analysis-ARIMA-LSTM
Stock price prediction using 4 different stocks check for accuracy between ARIMA and LSTM model

## OBJECTIVE:-
The following are some of the objectives of the study:
1. To review the usage of time series models for price prediction in the stock market, with a particular emphasis on the ARIMA, Keras with LSTM, and Prophet models.
2. To compile historical data on the stock prices of different stock of companies.
3. To test the various time series models for stock market price prediction.
4. To evaluate the overall performance of the various models and to determine the aspects
that contribute to their overall performance, respectively.
5. Based on the findings of the research, provide recommendations for the use of time
series models for the task of stock market price prediction.
Because an accurate stock market price prediction can have substantial significance for investors, corporations, and politicians, therefore this analysis is essential. The effectiveness of time series models, which are frequently utilized for predicting stock market prices, can be adversely impacted by several different circumstances. The research can provide insights into the usage of these models for price prediction on the stock market by comparing the performance of various models and identifying the factors contributing to their performance.
